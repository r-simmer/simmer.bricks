\usage{
interleave(.trj, resources, task, amount = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{.trj}{the trajectory object.}

\item{resources}{character vector of resource names.}

\item{task}{the timeout duration supplied by either passing a numeric or a
callable object (a function) which must return a numeric (negative values are
automatically coerced to positive).}

\item{amount}{the amount to seize/release, accepts either a numeric or a callable
object (a function) which must return a numeric.}
}
\value{
Returns the following chain of activities: \code{\link[simmer]{seize}}
(1) > \code{\link[simmer]{timeout}} > [\code{\link[simmer]{seize}} (token to 2)
> \code{\link[simmer:seize]{release}} (1) > \code{\link[simmer]{seize}} (2) >
\code{\link[simmer]{timeout}} > \code{\link[simmer:seize]{release}} (2) >
\code{\link[simmer:seize]{release}} (token to 2) > ... (repeat) ]
(see examples below). Thus, the total number of activities appended is
\code{length(resources) * 3 + (length(resources)-1) * 2}.
}
\description{
This brick encapsulates a chain of interleaved resources, i.e., the current
resource is not released until the next one in the chain is available. An
interesting propery of such a pattern is that, if one resource is blocked for
some reason, the whole chain stops.
}
\details{
Both \code{task} and \code{amount} accept a list of values/functions,
instead of a single one, that should be of the same length as \code{resources},
so that each value/function is applied to the resource of the same index.

The transition to the second and subsequent resources is guarded by a token,
an auxiliary resource whose capacity must be equal to the capacity + queue
size of the guarded resource, and its queue size must be infinite. For example,
if two resources are provided, \code{c("A", "B")}, the auxiliary resource will
be named \code{"B_token"}. If \code{capacity=2} and \code{queue_size=1} for B,
then \code{capacity=3} and \code{queue_size=Inf} must be the values for
B_token. But note that the user is responsible for adding such an auxiliary
resource to the simulation environment with the appropriate parameters.

\examples{
## These are equivalent:
trajectory() \%>\%
  interleave(c("A", "B"), c(2, 10), 1)

trajectory() \%>\%
  seize("A", 1) \%>\%
  timeout(2) \%>\%
  seize("B_token", 1) \%>\%
  release("A", 1) \%>\%
  seize("B", 1) \%>\%
  timeout(10) \%>\%
  release("B", 1) \%>\%
  release("B_token", 1)

}
