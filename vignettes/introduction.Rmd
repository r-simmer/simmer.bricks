## A motivating example

The `simmer` package provides a rich and flexible API to build discrete-event simulations. However, there are certain recurring patterns that are typed over and over again. The most common example is probably to spend some time holding a resource. Let us consider the basic example from the [_Introduction to `simmer`_](http://r-simmer.org/articles/simmer-01-introduction.html):

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(simmer)

patient.1 <- trajectory("patients' path") %>%
  ## add an intake activity 
  seize("nurse", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 15)) %>%
  release("nurse", 1) %>%
  ## add a consultation activity
  seize("doctor", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 20)) %>%
  release("doctor", 1) %>%
  ## add a planning activity
  seize("administration", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 5)) %>%
  release("administration", 1)
```

These `seize` > `timeout` > `release` blocks can be substituted by the `visit` verb, included in `simmer.bricks`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(simmer.bricks)

patient.2 <- trajectory("patients' path") %>%
  ## add an intake activity 
  visit("nurse", function() rnorm(1, 15)) %>%
  ## add a consultation activity
  visit("doctor", function() rnorm(1, 20)) %>%
  ## add a planning activity
  visit("administration", function() rnorm(1, 5))
```

Internally, `simmer.bricks` just uses `simmer` verbs, so both trajectories are equivalent:

```{r}
patient.1
patient.2
```

which means that you must have this in mind if you want to use a `rollback()` to loop over some part of the trajectory.

In summary, the `simmer.bricks` package is a repository of `simmer` activity patterns like this one. See `help(package="simmer.bricks")` for a comprehensive list.

## More compelling examples

### Delayed release

Some simulations require a resource to become inoperative for some time after a release. It is possible to simulate this with `simmer` using a technique that we call *delayed release*. Basically, while an arrival releases the resource and continues the trajectory, a clone of the latter keeps the resource busy for the time required; finally, the clone is removed. The main problem is that this *keeping the resource busy* must be implemented in different ways depending on the resource type, i.e., whether it is preemptive or not.

This package encapsulates all this logic in a very easy-to-use brick called `delayed_release()`:

```{r}
env <- simmer() %>%
  add_resource("res1") %>%
  add_resource("res2", preemptive=TRUE)

t <- trajectory() %>%
  seize("res1") %>%
  log_("res1 seized") %>%
  seize("res2") %>%
  log_("res2 seized") %>%
  # inoperative for 2 units of time
  delayed_release("res1", 2) %>% 
  log_("res1 released") %>%
  # inoperative for 5 units of time
  delayed_release("res2", 5, preemptive=TRUE) %>%
  log_("res1 released")

env %>%
  add_generator("dummy", t, at(0, 1)) %>%
  run() %>% invisible
```

If you are curious, you can print the trajectory above to see what happens behind the scenes.

### Parallel tasks

Another common pattern is to set up a number of parallel tasks with `clone()`. This could be challenging if the original arrival had resources seized. Let us consider the following case, in which a doctor and a nurse are visiting patients in a hospital room:

```{r, error=TRUE}
t <- trajectory() %>%
  seize("room") %>%
  clone(
    n = 2,
    trajectory("doctor") %>%
      timeout(1),
    trajectory("nurse") %>%
      timeout(2)) %>%
  synchronize(wait = TRUE) %>%
  timeout(0.5) %>%
  release("room",1)

simmer() %>%
  add_resource("room") %>%
  add_generator("visit", t, at(0)) %>%
  run()
```

This simulation fails. This is because the original arrival, which seized the room and follows the first path (doctor), finishes its duty in the first place. Given that `wait = TRUE` for the `synchronize()` activity, it means that the last clone to arrive there (the nurse in this case) continues, while the others are removed.

Solving this requires ensuring that the original arrival reaches the `synchronize()` activity in the last place (or in the first place if `wait = FALSE`), which can be tricky, as some asynchronous programming must be used. However, `simmer.bricks` provides the `do_parallel()` brick:

```{r}
env <- simmer()

t <- trajectory() %>%
  seize("room") %>%
  log_("room seized") %>%
  do_parallel(
    env,
    trajectory("doctor") %>%
      timeout(1) %>%
      log_("doctor path done"),
    trajectory("nurse") %>%
      timeout(2) %>%
      log_("nurse path done")
  ) %>%
  timeout(0.5) %>%
  release("room",1) %>%
  log_("room released")

env %>%
  add_resource("room") %>%
  add_generator("visit", t, at(0)) %>%
  run() %>% invisible
```

And everything just works.
